# Homework #3

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.

	* propTypes
		- propTypes is React's version of a poor man's type system. It is an object that describes the structure of the props of a component. In development, if the actual props do not match what is expected in the propTypes, warnings will occur. They are stripped out in production.
	* .map()
		- .map() is a higher order function of the Array object that is a core component of functional programming in Javascript. In React, it is often used to generate the markup for a component based on props or state.
	* setInterval and setTimeout
		- setInterval and setTimeout are asynchronous functions that allow a callback function to be called repeatedly over a set interval or once after a set amount of time, respectively.


2. Fork and clone this repo.  When you need to commit use the following commands.

	* Run: `npm install -g create-react-app`
	* Create a boilerplate React app called cards. `create-react-app cards`
	* Navigate into /cards and run the command: `npm start`
	* Your `<App />` component will render a `<Body />` component.
	* Create a file called `Body.js`.
	* `<Body />` will be a container for the `<Card />` components you create.
	* Try to emulate Instagram's layout for their cards.  
  	* Try creating multiple components to handle each part of Instagram's cards.  For example: a component for the likes count, a component for a comments container, a component for each comment, an image component, a separate image component for the author, etc.
	* Don't worry about the functionality.  Just try to emulate the appearance.
